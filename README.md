Concept 
This chatbot, named Luxy, aims to streamline hotel room bookings at Singapore's Oasis beach 
resort under pre-defined parameters.  It gathers basic user information like name, desired stay 
duration, and number of guests. Optionally, users can specify breakfast preferences and 
payment methods. The focus is on using flexible technology to facilitate efficient bookings that 
meet customer expectations. 
Luxy offers reservation assistance and details about Oasis beach resort. Users can inquire 
about amenities, room features, availability, and receive reservation support. The chatbot also 
addresses any further questions regarding the resort by providing general information. 
The interaction begins with the user initiating the chat. Luxy welcomes the user and collects 
their name and phone number.  Following this, the bot provides a brief overview of Oasis 
beach resort's services and its own capabilities, including making reservations, offering 
information, and answering questions about the hotel and rooms. Based on user requests, 
Luxy addresses specific inquiries about amenities, room features, and dining options. If a user 
shows interest in booking a room, the chatbot guides them through the process seamlessly, 
gathering necessary information and confirming the reservation. 
Development and testing: 
To create Luxy, Botpress will be used as the development and testing platform. Its strength 
lies in its flexibility and powerful features, including a user-friendly visual interface for designing 
conversational flows and Natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities. Additionally, 
Botpress's open-source nature allows for customization to meet the specific needs of the hotel 
booking operation. 
Evaluation and refinement: 
Once configured, Luxy's dialogues will be created, defining its responses to various user 
inputs. Integration with the hotel's knowledge base will then be established, allowing the bot 
to retrieve details about amenities and rooms. Following configuration, a personal assessment 
will ensure everything functions as intended.  Furthermore, feedback will be solicited from 
friends or colleagues who test the bot. Based on their input, adjustments will be made to Luxy's 
appearance and functionality. Finally, to maintain its usefulness and reliability, Luxy's 
performance will be monitored and adjustments are made as needed.
